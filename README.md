# ECoreNetto

## Introduction

ECoreNetto is a dotnet core library that is used to deserialize an Ecore meta-model for the purpose of code generation. Ecore is  a meta-model used to represent models in the Eclipse Modelling Framework. EMF is a powerful framework and code generation facility for building Java applications based on simple model definitions. The intention of ECoreNetto is not to be a port of EMF, it aims at bridging the gap to the .NET world to facilitate code generation of C# class libraries based on an Ecore model using the .NET code available tooling and libraries.
